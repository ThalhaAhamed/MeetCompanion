"""
Instance secrets that must never come from a default.

The session signing key used to be `API_KEY_SALT` with a hard-coded default,
which meant every install that did not set it shared one key - and anyone who
read the repository could mint a session cookie for any user id. The key is
now generated once per install and kept next to the database, unless the
deployment provides one explicitly through the environment.

Known placeholder values (from older .env.example files and dev scripts) are
treated as unset so a copied example file cannot silently downgrade security.
