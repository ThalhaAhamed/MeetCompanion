"""
Member roster and workspace membership.

Every meeting, memory, and MCP tool call is scoped to a workspace
(Organization) - there's no cross-workspace visibility. Signing up requires
either creating a brand new workspace or joining an existing one via its
join code, so a stranger can no longer land in someone else's data just by
signing up. Adding a teammate from the Members page (while already signed
in) always adds them to your own current workspace, no code needed.
