"""
Per-member session gate.

Signs a "<expires_at>.<user_id>.<hmac>" cookie value using the per-install
session secret (app/secrets.py) as the HMAC key - the signature only proves the token was issued by us and hasn't
expired; membership itself (has this user_id been removed?) is re-checked
against the database on every request, so removing a member in the Members
page revokes their live session immediately rather than waiting for the
cookie to expire.

Enforced by AuthGateMiddleware on every /api/* route except the auth/member
routes themselves (which do their own checks), webhooks (MeetStream calls
those, not a browser), and the MCP endpoints (gated separately by their own
bearer token, called by the voice agent rather than a browser).
